# Portfolio-Optimization
Optimizing the weights of a hypothetical portfolio of publicly traded companies across various sectors

In this project I utilized CVXPY to create and solve a convex optimization problem in order to optimally 
allocate weights to specific stocks based on old data. I was able to define an objective function and carry out the 
optimization to minimize risk given a specified(by me) level of return. 

I showed a monte-carlo simulation, after the optimization, of differently weighted portfolios. In the future plan to show the
risk free interest rate and the relationship to the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio!

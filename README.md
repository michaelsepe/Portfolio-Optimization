# Portfolio-Optimization
Optimizing the weights of a hypothetical portfolio of publicly traded companies across various sectors

In this project I utilized CVXPY to create and solve a convex optimization problem in order to optimally 
allocate weights to specific stocks based on old data. I was able to define an objective function and carry out the 
optimization to minimize risk given a specified(by me) level of return.
